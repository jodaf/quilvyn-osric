<h2>Adding Homebrew Choices to Quilvyn's OSRIC Rule Set</h2>

<p>
The OSRIC rule set allows you to add homebrew choices to most of its
selections: armor, weapons, races, and so on. The entry dialog for each
type of choice includes fields for all the information particular to that
type. For most choices, the values to enter into the dialog can be determined
by comparing them to similar choices from the core rules.
</p><p>
The input fields used to enter homebrew choices are similar to those used
by the Quilvyn editor&mdash;text fields, selection menus, checkboxes, etc.
One difference between the two is that you can enter multiple values into most
text boxes in the homebrew choices editor. For example, when entering a
homebrew race, you will likely want to enter multiple values in the Languages
text box. To do this, separate the individual values by commas:
Common,Goblin,Hobgoblin. If you ever need to enter a single value that contains
a comma into a text box, enclose the value in quotes: "May create and mend
magic weapons, armor, and shields".
</p><p>
Although the widest text boxes that Quilvyn uses show around 40 characters, you
can enter longer text values. Only 40 characters will show at once, but you can
use your arrow keys to move the cursor within the full text. Several examples
below show only the beginning portion of longer values entered into text boxes.

<p>
For homebrew armors, Quilvyn displays fields for entering the improvement to
armor class gained by using the armor, the maximum movement allowed when
wearing it, and its weight in pounds.
</p><p>
The example shown gives the values for field plate, as discussed in the
equipment section of the OSRIC rules. It adds -8 to the wearer's armor class
and limits movement to 90'.

<a name="class"><h2>Classes</h2></a>

<p>
When adding a homebrew class, Quilvyn displays fields that allow you to specify
optional class prerequisites, the experience points required to advance to each
level, class hit dice, THAC10 and save progressions, class features, weapon
proficiency progression, the penalty for using a non-proficient weapon, and
any spell slots gained by the class.
</p><p>
The Hit Dice entry is a list of three items that indicate the number of sides
on the dice, the maximum number of dice, and the number of points added to a
character's hit points each level after the maximum number of dice is reached.
For example, the Hit Dice entry for the cleric class is d8, 9,
2&mdash;indicating that a cleric character gains d8 hit points each level
through level 9, after which a fixed 2 hit points are added each level.
</p><p>
Several of the entries&mdash;experience required, THAC10, saves, weapon
proficiency, and spell slots&mdash;represent columns from tables in the OSRIC
rules. Each of these entries contains a set of items listing a class level and
the value of the attribute for the class at that level. For example, the Weapon
Proficiency entry for the Assassin class might read "3@1 4@5 5@9 6@13",
indicating that the class grants proficiency in 3 weapons at level 1, 4 weapons
at level 5, 5 weapons at level 9, and 6 weapons at level 13. (The first item in
all progressions is assumed to apply to level 1 in the class, so including the
"@1" is optional.) If the progression is regular, like the +1 increment to the
proficient weapon count every 4 levels in this example, intermediate values can
be replaced by "...", so the Assassin class Weapon Proficiency can equivalently
be shown as "3 4@5 ... 6@13". As another example, consider the THAC10 value for
the cleric class&mdash;10 at level 1, then reducing by 2 every three levels
through level 18, then dropping to -1 for all higher levels. Spelled out, this
progression would be "10 8@4 6@7 4@10 2@13 0@16 -1@19". However, since the
progression is regular through level 18, this sequence can be shortened to "10
8@4 ... -1@19".
</p><p>
The example shows entries for a Necromancer class that has similar features to
the core Illusionist class. Instead of the high dexterity score required by
the Illusionist class, this Necromancer class requires a high charisma score,
and it gains the ability to turn undead as a cleric at level 10.

In Quilvyn, <i>features</i> describe the effects of class and racial features.
When adding a homebrew feature, enter the section of the character sheet (one

should appear, then enter the note text. You can enter multiple sections and
notes, but the number of sections entered must equal the number of notes.
Feature notes can both reference and modify character attributes; see the

<a name="attrs"><h2>Using Character Attributes in Prerequisites and Notes</h2></a>
<p>
There are three places that you might want to use references to character
attributes when adding homebrew choices: prerequisites for homebrew classes
and races; in feature notes that modify character attributes; and embedded in
feature notes and spell descriptions. Attribute references appear somewhat
differently in each of these contexts. To illustrate each use, we'll expand
the definition of the Lizard Man homebrew race shown above.
</p>

<h2>Using attributes in prerequisites</h2>

<p>
In the OSRIC rules, each of the non-human races has minimum ability score
requirements for player characters: dwarfs must have a strength of at least 8
and a constitution of 12 or more; elves require a minimum dexterity of 7 and a
score of at least 8 in constitution, intelligence, and charisma; and so on.
We can give the Lizard Man homebrew race a similar requirement&mdash;for
example, a minimum dexterity of 7 and constitution of 10&mdash;by adding text
to the race's Prerequisite field:
</p>
<img src='../Images/hbos-attr-1.jpg' alt='Lizard Man minimum attributes'/>

<p>
Given this definition, Quilvyn will generate tests for these requirements and
will show a validation error if a Lizard Man character has a dexterity score
of less than 7 or a constitution score of less than 10.
</p><p>
Within prerequisites, Quilvyn recognizes the common comparison operators
(&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, ==, !=), and you can use the OR operator (||) to
require that at least one of a set of prerequisites is satisfied:
</p><p>
<code>intelligence &gt;= 15 || wisdom &gt;= 15</code>
</p><p>
When making a comparison to a text value rather than a number, surround the
value with single or double quotes. Quilvyn also supports the matching
operators =~ (matches) and !~ (does not match) with strings. The first of these
two prerequisites requires that the character have a Lawful Good alignment,
while the second allows any good alignment:
</p><p>
<code>alignment == 'Lawful Good'</code><br/>
<code>alignment =~ 'Good'</code>
</p><p>
(You can think of the =~ and !~ operators as "contains" and "does not contain",
but they actually perform a pattern match, treating their second operand as a
regular expression. This means that certain characters, such as * and ?, have
special meanings if they appear in the second operand. The Mozilla project
provides a web page with
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions">a detailed description of regular expressions</a>.)
</p>

<h2>Using features to modify character attributes</h2>

<p>
With the Lizard Man homebrew race definition complete, the next step is to
create corresponding homebrew features for the Lizard Man racial
features&mdash;Natural Swimmer, Natural Weapons, Slow, Tough Hide, and Lizard
Man Ability Adjustment. Quilvyn defines the Slow feature for us, since some of
the core races (e.g., Halfling) also have it, so we can use it without defining
a homebrew feature. The definitions for the Natural Swimmer and Natural Weapons
features are <a href="#feature">shown above</a>. That leaves the Tough Hide and
Lizard Man Ability Adjustment features to be defined here.
</p><p>
The OSRIC rules specify that a Lizard Man has a tough and leather hide that
gives it an armor class of 5&mdash;5 better than an unarmored human. The Tough
Hide feature will note this improvement and adjust the displayed armor class
appropriately. Since the feature affects the character's armor class, we'll
place the feature note in the combat section of the character sheet:
</p>

<img src='../Images/hbos-attr-feature-1.jpg' alt='Tough Hide feature'/>

<p>
Given this definition, Quilvyn will automatically generate a rule that adds -5
to the character's armor class value, and the note will appear in italics on
the character sheet. For readability, character attributes in feature notes
must appear as shown above, with initial capital letters and spaces between
words.
</p><p>
Single features can modify multiple attributes; in these cases, the note should
list the individual modifications separated by slashes. For example, if Lizard
Man characters automatically gain 2 in constitution and strength, but subtract
2 from their intelligence, the definition of the Lizard Man Ability Adjustment
feature might look like this:
</p>

<img src='../Images/hbos-attr-feature-2.jpg' alt='Lizard Man Ability Adjustment feature'/>

<p>
Given this definition, Quilvyn will automatically generate rules to adjust
the character's ability scores. This note will also appear in italics, showing
that Quilvyn has made the adjustments.
</p><p>
As a convenience, notes in the save and skill sections can modify saving throw
values and skill modifiers by referencing the save type or skill name directly;
the saves. and skillModifiers. prefixes are not necessary. For example,
features with the following two notes will automatically subtract one from the
character's required saving throws vs. wands and add 5 and 10 to the
character's chance of success when climbing walls and hiding in shadows:
</p>

<code>-1 Wands</code><br/>
<code>+5 Climb Walls/+10 Hide In Shadows</code>

<h2>Embedding attributes in features notes and spell descriptions</h2>

<p>
Nearly all spells, as well as some class and race features, have effects that
vary based on character attributes. For example: rangers gain a damage bonus
against evil humanoids and giants equal to their level; dwarfs gain a +1 bonus
to saves vs. poison for each 3.5 points of constitution; and the <i>Airy
Water</i> spell last a number of turns equal to the caster's level.
</p><p>
You can embed references to character attributes in the text of feature notes
and spell descriptions by enclosing them within the characters %{}. Using this
ability, the note for the ranger's Damage Bonus feature looks like this:
</p><p>
<code>+%{levels.Ranger} melee damage vs. evil humanoids and giantish foes</code>
</p><p>
When Quilvyn displays this note on the character sheet, it first replaces the
reference to the character's levels.Ranger attribute with its value, so the
note might appear on the sheet as
</p><p>
<code>+6 melee damage vs. evil humanoids and giantish foes</code>
</p><p>
Beyond simple references, Quilvyn supports performing calculations within
embedded references. The note for the Assassination feature of the assassin
class looks like this:
</p><p>
<code>%{levels.Assassin*5+50}% - 5%/2 foe levels chance that a strike kills a surprised target</code>
</p><p>
Within embedded references, Quilvyn supports the common comparison operators
(&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, ==, !=), the common arithmetic operators
(+, -, *, /, unary -), AND (&amp;&amp;), OR (||), matching (=~, !~),
and integer division (//). It also supports the ternary if-then-else operator
(?:) and the operators &lt;? and &gt;?, which return the smaller and larger
of their two operands, respectively. Using these operators, we can define the
note for the assassin Bonus Languages feature as follows, taking into account
that the number of languages depends both upon the assassin's level and their
intelligence:
</p><p>
<code>May learn %{levels.Assassin-8&lt;?4&lt;?intelligence-14} additional choices from alignment languages, druidic, or thieves\' cant</code>
</p><p>
Within spell descriptions, in addition to <a href="#attrs">common character
attributes</a>, Quilvyn makes available the special character attribute lvl.
This variable refers to the caster level appropriate to the specific spell:
casterLevels.C for the C1 spell <i>Bless</i>, casterLevels.D for the D4 spell
<i>Call Woodland Beings</i>, casterLevels.I for the I2 spell <i>Deafness</i>,
and so on. Using the lvl attribute allows you to incorporate the caster level
into a spell description that works for multiple classes. The description of
the <i>Enhance Ability</i> spell example from
<a href="#spell">adding a spell</a> reads:
</p><p>
<code>R30' Increases target's chosen ability by 4 for %{lvl} rd</code>
</p><p>
When showing this description on the character sheet, Quilvyn will replace the
reference to lvl with the character's cleric or magic user level, as
appropriate. For example, the description for the M3 <i>Enhance Skill</i>
spell for a level 7 magic user will read:
</p>

<code>R30' Increases target's chosen ability by 4 for 7 rd</code>
